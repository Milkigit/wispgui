wispgui
=======

GUI for WISP operation and demonstration.

Refer to [the Python Guide](http://python-guide.org/) before committing code to
this repository, especially the [style
section](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style.html).
Readability and simplicity are key.  Apologize profusely for performance
optimizations, even if they are necessary.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have `pip` installed, then use it to install the Python modules
on which this project depends:

    $ pip -r py-requirements.txt

To run the GUI application, you must also have
[PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) installed.  Your
operating system probably has a package for it.  As of July 2013, there is an
Ubuntu package called `python-qt4` and a MacPorts package called `py27-pyqt4`.
